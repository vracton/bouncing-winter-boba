nice bouncing boba plushie!!!!!
see [here](https://vracton.github.io/bouncing-winter-boba/)!

## Features:
- falling snow that collects at bottom of screen
- bouncing boba that "stains" and moves the snow
- sometimes a bit laggy

in the future, i'd like to make it so the boba only bounces off the top layer of snow - i couldn't quite figure out how to do so here

To use this locally, simply download index.html and boba.jpg (or your own image if you'd like) and open the index.html file, no other dependencies or files are needed.
